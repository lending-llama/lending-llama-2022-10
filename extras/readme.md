## Background on Conversion from Markdown to HTML for Summary

### For the Reader

GitHub does not support all the Markdown features that I use in the summary. Therefore, I have rendered the Markdown to HTML. As GitHub does not render HTML, above are links for easy viewing.


### For the Author

Rendering Markdown is still a pita. GFM does almost everything, including graphs with Mermaid. However, 
* it still does not generate a table of contents automatically.
* it does not allow me to colorize individual words, even though it should according to my understanding of the [spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#html-block).

Also, if editing and rendering are separated, discrepancies between preview & final rendering become an issue again.

Therefore: stick with Typora.

Themes for HTML export:
* light – GitHub
* dark – Night
